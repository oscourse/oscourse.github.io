<P>You will walk through the
mechanical steps of configuring, compiling, installing, and
testing a kernel. This will make sure you can handle the
mechanics, let you see first-hand the time scales of some of the
development steps in kernel programming.
You will then implement a simple system call and a simple
kernel module, and write user-level applications to test 
your implementation.</P>

<H2>Important Instructions Before You start</H2>
</a>

Please read the following instructions carefully. It has important information.

<OL>

<li>
Here's a list of <a href=assignments/kernel_compile_syscall_module_faq.txt>frequently asked questions [FAQ]</a> that I'll keep updating.
</li>

<li>
<b>LOCATION:</B> It is best to do the assignment in the CS department's
Instructional Lab, which is located in the G-7 of Engineering Building. 
NOTE: This assignment *CANNOT* be done on bingsuns or any other 
computing facility in the University.
</LI>

<!--
<LI>
<B>TEAMS:</B> I am requesting you all to form teams of maximum 2 members
each.  The original plan was to have each of you do the assignment
individually, which seems infeasible now due to a big resource crunch.
We have only 20 machines in this lab. There are 34 students in our section
alone. In addition, there is a strong chance that another section of 33
students may end up doing the same assignment in the Linux lab around the
same time window. This means about 67 students competing for 20 machines.
So when you work in the lab, both members of a team should use one single
machine - not two machines.
</LI>

<LI>
<B>DEMOS:</B> You can work in teams of 2, but will give the demo of the
assignment individually. Hopefully, this will force both team members to
pay attention to the entire assignment. The goal of teaming up is *NOT* to
split-up the work among each other. Rather, it is to make better use of
few computers in the lab, and hopefully, two people can pace each other's
learning better through discussions.
</LI>

<LI>
<B>LONE RANGERS:</B> It is likely that most of you would opt to work in a
team. If any of you wants to do the assignment individually, please email
me *soon*. Working alone may be fine if the number of such 'lone rangers'
is small or if you can use your own computer to do this assignment.
Otherwise, I may have to require you to work in a team to make better use
of limited computers.
</LI>

<LI>
<B>FINDING A TEAM MEMBER:</B> If you want a team member, but do not know
anyone, please email me and Rohit soon. We will try to put you in touch
with someone else in similar position.
</LI>
-->

<B>USING YOUR OWN MACHINES:</B> You can potentially use
your own machine on which you are brave enough
to experiment with Linux Kernel programming. Note that this should be a
machine that you can finally bring to the department to show your demo.
Another option is that you could work on a machine at home, and then move
your code to one of the lab machines just before the demo time. However,
this second option runs into the danger that your kernel configuration may
not match the hardware of machines in the instructional lab. So try the second
option at your own risk.
</LI>

<LI>
<B>START EARLY:</B> Get started on the assignment early. 
This cannot be stressed enough. It is not difficult, 
but some steps, such as repeatedly compiling the kernel, may take a long time. 
Try not to keep work stacked up close to the deadline because too many students may
try to access the few lab computers during the last few days.
There are many other classes using the lab, so you may even have trouble
finding a seat towards the deadline.
</LI>

<LI>
<B>ASKING FOR HELP:</B> In this assignment , you are free to ask 
for help from your classmates on Part A of the assignment, including
what configurations they use. If anything this is encouraged. However,
please do Parts B and C on your own. The thumbrule is: never 
ask for code from others OR give code to others. Of course, you are encouraged to ask
for help from the TA or the Instructor on any part of the assignment.
</LI>
</OL>


<a name=parta>
<H2>Part A: Installing, configuring, and compiling Linux Kernel</H2>
</a>

<P>Perform the following, on a machine in the instructional Lab, 
or on a machine of your own that you can bring in to demonstrate.</P>

<P>The following instructions are for use with version 3.0.XX of Linux kernel 
over Debian distribution.
Preferably get hold of the latest stable kernel from <a href=http://ftp.kernel.org>http://ftp.kernel.org</a>.
Also, there's currently no choice but to use Debian distribution of Linux
in the instructional lab due to the way the system is set up (to boot your 
kernel image over the network).
As an alternative, if you have your own machine, you are 
encouraged to use the Ubuntu Distribution of Linux, which is based on Debian.
The Ubuntu installation is almost a no-brainer, but requires some post-installation
configuration effort to get necessary packages installed.
If you are using a different Linux distribution or kernel 
version, you will need to adapt the instructions below, 
or install a compatible version of Linux.</P>

<P>
I recommend strongly that you use a 3.0.XX kernel version,
so that if you want to later move your code to one of
the lab machines you will face minimal surprises.</P>

<P>These detailed instructions explain one way of doing the job.
You may not end up following exactly the same set of steps.
There are several other equally good ways of
doing each step.  If you have built Linux kernels before, you are
free to do it your own way, so long as it works.  There is a
chance that these instructions may miss some details.
If you catch anything that looks like a typo or omission in 
the description, please let us know.</P>

<OL TYPE=1>

<LI><P><b>[DO THIS ONLY IF YOU ARE USING A MACHINE IN THE G-7 INSTRUCTIONAL LAB]</b> 
The system is set up in the lab in a way that allows you to boot your linux
kernel image (<b>Virtual System</b>) over the network from a central server. This frees you up to use
any of the machines in the lab. There will be no individually assigned machines.
</P>

<P>
Our system administrators have created two virtual systems per student.
A virtual system is a preinstalled Debian distribution of Linux available at a
central server that can be booted over the network from any of the lab machines.
(If you are curious, it uses a boot system called PXE Boot -- Google the keywords
for more details.)
Your two virtual systems will be named <b>yourid</b> and <b>yourid.safe</b>, 
where <i>yourid</i> is the same as the first part of your bu email 
id yourid@cs.binghamton.edu. (However, besides the id name, there is no other link
between your virtual system and your BU or CS accounts. The virtual system is a completely 
different linux image within the lab. In particular, your BU account/passwords won't
work here.)
The <i>yourid</i> virtual system will be your development/experimental version
whose kernel image you can change. The <i>yourid.safe</i> system has a clean
kernel image that does not change. You can boot into the safe image if your
development version crashes and becomes unbootable for any reason (which it will!).
The only difference between the two virtual systems is that they boot off 
different kernel images, but their underlying file system is the same.
In other words, if you created any files when booted under the <i>yourid</i> 
image, you will be able to see it when booted under <i>yourid.safe</i> image.
Both share a common installation of Debian distribution, but boot off
different kernel images. If all this sounds too confusing, just go through 
the following  instructions in the lab and things will become clear.
</P>

<P>
By this time, you should have verified that your virtual system works in the G-7 lab 
using the <a href=https://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~sysadmin/virtual.html>
<b>Instructions to access your virtual system in the G-7 Lab.</b> </a>
If you haven't, please do so NOW before proceeding any further.
</P>

<P>
<b>CAUTION:</b> DO NOT boot your virtual system images simultaneously on 
two physical machines. This will mess up the file-system of your virtual system and
render it unusable. This also applies to simultaneously booting your experimental 
and .safe virtual systems -- <b>they still share the same file system underneath.</b>
</P>

<P><b>[DO THIS ONLY IF YOU ARE USING YOUR PERSONAL MACHINE]</b> 
Install a Linux distribution on your machine.  
If you have installed Linux before, you should have no problem with this.
Those students who have not done this
before can ask for assistance from the instructor or from
another student in the class.</P>

<P>Before you do this, check how much RAM is installed in your
machine, by watching the BIOS messages as it boots. 
</P>

<P>When the Linux installation script asks you about how you want
the disk partitioned, if you are inexperienced, you use the
default partition structure.  However, if you do, it will allocate
most of the disk as one huge root partition, and if you ever need
to run <I>fsck</I> it will take a very long time.  If you are
curious enough to repartition the disk, you may want
to consider creating your own partitions.  For example, you could
set up a system for future dual-booting with the following
partitions:</P>

<UL>
<LI>a small (maybe 200 Mbytes) "/boot" partition, near the beginning of the disk</LI>
<LI>a modest "/" (root) partition, big enough to hold all the software (maybe 15 Gbytes)</LI>
<LI>a modest secondary root partition (call it "/spare"), of the same size</LI>
<LI>a "/home" directory, to hold files that you want to preserve,
if you have to reinstall the operating system later.</LI>
<LI>a swap partition, about twice the size of your main memory.</LI>
</UL>

<P>When the installation asks you what components you want to
install, you <EM>cannot</EM> play it safe by choosing "everything".
You will need to just select the components that are
needed for a kernel software development workstation.  This
includes, at least the C compiler, linker, and standard libraries,
your favorite text editor(s), kernel sources, and probably also
kernel documentation.  You also want to install networking
support, enough to use <I>ftp</I> and <I>ssh</I>.  (It may also
help to have some of the network diagnostic tools.)  You probably
also want to install enough of the X-windows environment 
to use a browser (Firefox/Mozilla).  The
simplest way to do this is to choose the standard "workstation"
configuration.</P>

<!--
<P><b>[IMPORTANT]</b> When you are asked for 'root' password, please use the common password 
given in the class. This will enable other students to use thee machine 
for their assignments as well. If you use any other root password, your
machine may be reinstalled by others and you may possibly lose any work 
you haven't backed up.</P>
-->

<P>Be sure to create yourself at least one ordinary user account,
so that you don't have to do all your work as "root".  You may
also want to create a "guest" account for use by other students,
later, if you set your machines up in pairs for remote console
message logging using the serial ports.<P>

<P>When the installation script asks you for a hostname and an IP
address, choose DHCP, which will dynamically acquire and assign an IP address
for your machine. </P>

<P>After the installation of the OS, power on and boot up the
machine, if it is not already running, and log in as "root".</P>
</LI>

<LI><P>Log in again as root at the text console. Set yourself
up a user account under a name of your choice (let's call it your_user_name -- replace your_user_name with whatever user name you want).
To do this, use the command <I>adduser</I> as follows:</P>

<PRE>adduser your_user_name</PRE> 

<P>
Then execute <I>passwd your_user_name</I> to set the password
of this account to some password of your choice.</P>

<P>Use this account for most of your
development work.  
</P>

<P>It is recommend that you only do as root those things
that require it, to reduce the risk of clobbering your system if
you make a mistake.  In general, it is wise to log in first as a
normal user, and then just "su" to root temporarily when
necessary, or to use one of the Linux "virtual consoles" for a
separate root login that you use just for the commands that
require it.</P>

<P>Or better yet, add your regular id to sudoers list
under "/etc/sudoers" and the use the "sudo" command to 
execute privileged intructions. This forces you to be aware 
that you are doing something as root.</P>

<P>If you are working from the normal console of the machine, you
can select any of six virtual consoles using the function keys
F1-F6.  F1 is the initial virtual console. F7 is reserved for the
X-windows display. To switch between consoles, use the Ctrl-Alt-F(N) 
keys combination where N = the virtual console number.
For example, if you are running X-windows, you
can switch over to virtual console #2 using the F2 key to log in
as root and do something, then switch back to the X-windows
display using F7.</P>
</LI>

<LI><P>If you don't want to work with a graphical interface
for whatever reason, first check the current runlevel of the 
system using the 
command <pre>/sbin/runlevel</pre>. Then go to the 
<pre>/etc/rcN.d</pre> directory where N = the runlevel. Here
remove the symbolic link named Sxxgdm, where xx is some number
(you can find this out by doing "ls S*gdm").
</P></LI>

<LI><P>Shut off all unnecessary services.  
One way, while logged in via the X-windows (GUI) interface 
(F7 console), is to use the command
<I>services-admin</I> to select system services for
configuration. However, this provides only a limited selection
of services. Another way, 
is to identify the runlevel, as in the previous step using <pre>/sbin/runlevel</pre>
Then go to /etc/rcN.d directory (where N=runlevel),
and remove the symbolic links for services you don't want.
Be careful when you do this because <b>you DO NOT want to 
turn off critical system services.</b></P>

<P>
You will need to exercise
a little bit of trial and error if you want to get the absolute
minimum set of services.  Since occasionally you may want to use
a browser to look up information and download
code, you may want to have a few more than the minimum set
of services running. This could include:
<UL>
<LI><I>syslog</I> - logs system messages.  You probably want this.
The system log is one of the main kernel debugging tools.</LI>
<LI><I>portmap</I> - converts RPC program numbers into DARPA protocol port numbers.
This is used for both internal and external RPC.  You may be able to
do without it, if you are only doing bare-bones kernel development.</LI>
<LI><I>networking</I> - provides networking services.  To use <I>ssh</I>
and web browsing you will need it.</LI>
<LI><I>xinetd</I> - provides Internet services by listening on IP ports and
starting up programs to serve connection requests.  Like <I>portmap</I>,
this is used for internal services as well as external.  To use
X-windows you will need it.</LI>
<LI><I>sshd</I> - ssh server to enable you to log in remotely from another machine within the lab. Useful occasionally, if your console/keyboard gets hung.</LI>
</UL>

</LI>

<LI><P>Test the system with the reduced services, by rebooting,
and verifying that the system is working well enough for you to
continue with the rest of this exercise. You can use the command "reboot"
to reboot. Remember to press F12 and use network boot each time you reboot.</P>

<P><EM>Do <B>not</B></EM> power-cycle your system to
reboot.  It is will prematurely age your hardware.
If <I>halt</I> and <I>reboot</I> don't work, try &lt;CTRL>&lt;ALT>&lt;DEL>;
if that does not work, use the soft-reboot switch (not the power switch) 
if your machine has one. Press the power button only as the last resort.</P>

</LI>


<LI><P>At this stage, get a copy of kernel sources.  
You can download them via ftp from 
<A HREF="http://ftp.kernel.org/">ftp.kernel.org</A>.  
</LI>



<LI><P>As the normal user to whose home directory you copied the
kernel source code, extract the kernel source tree from the
archive file.  For example, you could next do the following:</P>

<PRE>cd /home/your_user_name
tar xvzf linux-3.0.XX.XX.tar.gz  
ln -s linux-3.0.XX.XX linux</PRE>

<P>Notice that the kernel source tree version, "3.0.XX.XX" in the example above,
should be replaced by whatever kernel version you are using, and if your file
is bzip2ed instead of gzipped, you use the tar option "j" instead of "z".</P>
</LI>

<LI><P>Before modifying the kernel source tree, you should back up (make another copy) of the 
linux-3.0.XX.XX.tar.gz file for insurance. 
</LI>

<LI><P>Once you have the kernel source tree uncompressed and untarred,
cd into the source directory ("linux" in the examples above), and configure the kernel, as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Execute the command
<PRE>cd linux
make mrproper</PRE>
to remove junk left from the old configuration
(I've heard this may not be necessary with the latest kernel Makefile,
but I have not verified it sufficiently to skip this step. In any case, it does no harm.)
</LI>
<LI>do "<TT>make menuconfig</TT>" (or "<TT>make xconfig</TT>", if you have a GUI working successfully inside X-windows.)</LI>
</UL>

<P>The kernel comes in a default configuration, determined by
the people who put together the kernel source code distribution.
It will include support for nearly everything, since it is
intended for general use, and is huge.  It will take a long time to
compile and a long time to load. For use in this course, you want a
different kernel configuration.  The "make menuconfig" step allows you to
choose that configuration.  It will present you with a series of
menus, from which you will choose the options you want to
include. For most options you have three choices: (blank) leave it
out; (M) compile it as a module, which will only be loaded if the
feature is needed; (*) compile it monolithically into the
kernel, so it will always be there from the time the kernel first
loads.</P>

<P>There are couple of specific things you want to accomplish with your
reconfiguration.
</p>
<UL>
<LI><P>Reduce the size of the kernel, by leaving out unnecessary
components.  This is helpful for kernel development. A small
kernel will take less time to compile and less time to load.
It will also leave more memory for you to use, resulting
in less page swapping and faster compilations.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Retain the modules necessary to use the hardware installed
on your system.  To do this without including just about everything
conceivable, you need to know what hardware is installed on your
system.  You can find out about that in several ways.</P></LI>
</UL>
<p> These two steps are highly recommended, but don't spend an
unreasonable amount of time doing this. The more you can reduce the kernel 
size and module count, the more it will greatly speed up your 
later assignments. </P>

<P>All of the lab computers for this course should have similar
hardware. However, if
you have a machine of your own you will need to figure out what
hardware it has and what software OS features you need,
so that you include all (and only) the necessary components
in your kernel.</P>

<P>If you have a running Linux system with a working kernel, one way to
find out about what hardware drivers you are using is to look at the
system log files, <I>/var/log/syslog</I> and <I>/var/log/messages</I>. 
You can also use the commands "lspci" or "dmesg".
Otherwise, check the
hardware documentation for your system, or ask the instructor or TA.

<P>Using the available information, knowledge about your own
system if you are not using the lab, and common sense, select a
reasonable set of options.  Along the way it would be a good idea
to read through the on-line help descriptions for a least all the
top-level menu options, so that you become more familiar with the
range of drivers and software components in the Linux kernel.</P>

<P>Before exiting the final menu level and saving the
configuration, it is also a good idea to save it to a named file, using
the "Save Configuration to an Alternate File" option.  By saving
different configurations under different names you can reload a
configuration without going through all the menu options
again.
</P>

<P>If you become frustrated with this process, you can compare
your .config file with the default one normally present in /boot directory.
<!--
You can also download a configuration file that I used, 
<A HREF="sample_config">sample_config</A> for 2.6.29.1 kernel.
Use that, either as a starting point or as-is. However, note that 
I use this configuration for my own virtual system and it may or 
may not work for yours. It is also not optimized for a small 
kernel size, so you should that part on your own.
-->
</P>

</LI>

<LI>Do the following <I>make</I> steps:
<PRE>make bzImage
make modules</PRE>
<P>The first command will compile the kernel and create a compressed binary image of the kernel. 
After the first step, the kernel image can be found at arch/x86/boot/bzImage (for a x86 
based processor). The second command will compile the dynamically loadable kernel modules you
have selected in the configuration step. The result will be creation of .ko files for each module.
For example, if you chose to compile the network device driver for the Realtek 8139 card as a module,
the  `driver/net/' directory will contain a file with the name 8139too.ko.
</P>

<P>If there are error messages from any of the <I>make</I> stages, you may be
able to solve them by going back and playing with the
configuration options.  It seems (from my experience) that some
options require other options, or cannot be used in conjunction
with other options.  These dependencies and conflicts are not
documented.  I had to solve such problems by guesswork, based on
the compilation or linkage error messages.  For example, if the
linker complains about a missing definition of some symbol in some
module, you might either turn on an option that seems likely to
provide a definition for the missing symbol, or turn off the
option that made reference to the symbol.</P>
</LI>

<LI><P>When you have built a kernel without any fatal compilation or
linkage errors (There may still be a few warning messages. Unfortunately, the Linux kernel team is not perfect.),
you are ready to install the kernel.  As root, do the following:</P>
<PRE>make modules_install
make install</PRE>

<P>The "<TT>make modules_install</TT>" and "<TT>make install</TT>"
steps need to be done as root, since they write into system
directories (<I>/boot</I> and <I>/lib/modules</I>).
The kernel goes into <I>/boot</I>, and has a name starting with "vmlinuz" and
including the version number.  The modules go into a sub-directory of
<I>/lib/modules</I> named after the version number.</P></LI>

<LI>
<P>
[<b>ONLY IF USING LAB MACHINE</b>] 
Do the following step each time you compile and install a new 
kernel (assuming your kernel version is 3.0.XX).  
This creates an initial ramdisk that is an archive of 
certain critical modules which need to be preloaded by the system 
at boot time, i.e. the system cannot wait to load these modules
till after a complete boot up of the system.
<pre>
$ cd /boot
$ mkinitramfs -o initrd.img-3.0.XX 3.0.XX
</pre>

Do the following two steps only once
at the beginning when you start with kernel assignments
OR later if you change the kernel versions you use.
<pre>
$ rm initrd.img
$ ln -s initrd.img-3.0.XX initrd.img
</pre>

IMPORTANT: Now check if you have the following two symbolic 
links are correctly set up in your /boot directory.
<pre>
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 14 2008-01-30 22:34 initrd.img -> initrd.img-3.0.XX
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 14 2008-01-30 22:33 vmlinuz -> vmlinuz-3.0.XX
</pre>
This last step is important for your image to boot correctly 
using network boot via the PXE boot system. There is a script 
at the PXE boot server which runs  every 5 seconds, picks up
your kernel image (vmlinuz) and ram disk image (initrd.img),
and copies them to correct locations in the server so that next
time you can boot off your new kernel image.
So make sure that these two symbolic links point to 
the correct kernel image that you want to boot next time.
</P>

<P>
[<b>ONLY IF USING PERSONAL MACHINE</B>]Edit the file <I>/boot/grub/menu.lst</I>. 
If it has a line with "nomenu" or "hiddenmenu",
comment that out (by adding "#" at the beginning).  Also find the line
that specifies the timeout for the menu and increase it to a number of seconds
large enough for you to read and use the menu. The default timeout is 5 seconds. I use 30 seconds.</P>
</LI>

<LI><P>Reboot the system into your new kernel.
Watch the messages.  See if it works.  If it does not, reboot with the
old (safe) kernel, try to fix what went wrong, and repeat until you have a 
working new kernel.</P></LI>

<a name=partb>
<H2>Part B: System Calls</H2>
</a>

<OL>
<LI><P>Now, using the concepts learned in the class, 
implement and test a system call that
returns the current system time by means of a call-by-reference argument.
More specifically, your system call should have the following prototype as seen
by user-level applications.

<pre>
int my_xtime(struct timespec *current_time);
</pre>

<tt>struct timespec</tt> is defined in include/linux/time.h as follows:

<pre>
struct timespec {
        time_t  tv_sec;         /* seconds */
        long    tv_nsec;        /* nanoseconds */
};
</pre>

The system call should first verify that user memory space, pointed to by <tt>current_time</tt>,
is valid and writable. If not, is should return a failure (EFAULT) to the user process. 
If the memory-check succeeds, then it should copy the contents of the kernel's <tt>xtime</tt>
variable to user space address (pointed to by current_time argument). The system call should also 
print the current time in nanoseconds, to the console using the <tt>printk()</tt> function.
</li>

<li>
Also write a user-level application which calls your new system call <tt>my_xtime(...)</tt>
and prints out the time obtained from the call-by-reference argument.
</OL>

<a name=partc>
<H2>Part C: Kernel Module</H2>
</a>

<OL>

<LI><P>Now, using the concepts learned in the class, 
implement, compile, and test a module that
implements a <tt>myxtime</tt> file in <tt>/proc</tt> file-system.
More specifically, your module should create a read-only file <tt>/proc/myxtime</tt>.
The file should support the <tt>read()</tt> operation. When <tt>read()</tt> is
called, it should return a single ASCII string with two numerical substrings 
separated by a single space. For example, it must return a string of the form

<pre>
378959784 384958
</pre>
if the system time variable, <tt>xtime</tt> was set to

<LI>
Note that, instead of using <tt>create_proc_entry</tt> as mentioned in the class, you can 
also use another kernel function, <tt>create_proc_read_entry</tt>, which is defined in
<tt>include/linux/proc_fs.h</tt>. Its usage could be something as follows:

<pre>
create_proc_read_entry("myxtime", 0, NULL, my_xtime_read, NULL);
</pre>

You'll need to figure out as to what do the different arguments above mean.
</LI>

<LI>
Also, provide a user-level application program that demonstrates your module.
One such application could be written as follows (please fill in the missing code):
</LI>

<pre>
#define N ...

struct timeval gtodTimes[N];
char *procClockTimes[N];

...

for( i=0; i &lt; N; i++)
{
	my_xtime = fopen("/proc/myxtime", "r");
	gettimeofday(&gtodTimes[i], 0);
	fgets(procClockTime[i], LENGTH, my_xtime);
	fclose(my_xtime);
}

for(i=0; i &lt; N; i++) {
	printf("...", gtodTimes[i], procClockTime[i]);
	// fix the output format appropriately in the above line
}

</pre>

</LI>

<LI>
Run the user-level program for various values of <tt>N</tt> (both very small and very large).
Observe the apparent difference in resolution of time between <tt>gettimeofday()</tt>
and <tt>xtime</tt>. Explain the reason for the difference in your report.
</LI>


<LI>Now, change the module so that <I>init_module()</I> returns -1,
recompile, and retest. What happens? Why?</LI>

<OL>

<LI><P>Now, change both the implementations of your system call and 
your module so that system call, <I>init_module()</I>
and/or <I>cleanup_module()</I> do some thing bad. Compile it.  If
it compiles OK, test it, but <EM><B>before testing it</B></EM>, use
"sync" to synchronize the file system in-memory structures with
those on disk, since it is likely that the system will crash, and
you will need to reboot.</P>

<P>The following are some typical errors. Try them one at a time.
Some of these may be caught
at compilation or link time, some may only cause problems when
you make the system call, or use <tt>insmod</tt> or <tt>rmmod</tt>
with the module.</P>

<UL>
<LI>division by zero</LI>
<LI>dereferencing a null pointer</LI>
<LI>returning no value or a value other than zero from <I>init_mod</I></LI>
<LI>calling a C library routine (<I>e.g.,</I> <I>malloc()</I> or <I>printf()</I>)
from inside a kernel module</LI>
<LI>whatever else that you think might cause a problem</LI>
</UL>

<P>Repeat a few such experiments, and see if you can hang or
crash the entire system. Keep a journal of what you try, and what
effects you observed. Save copies of the "bad" code that you tested,
by giving them different names.<P>

<P>BEWARE that some of the things you do may have no immediate
visible effect, but may have a delayed effect that is disastrous.
This is generally the case if you write garbage into random
locations of kernel memory.  The location you corrupt may not be
referenced to a while.  It will be referenced later, and then the
effect will occur.  Therefore, you cannot assume that the thing
you did most recently is necessarily the cause of a crash.</P>

<P><EM>Do not go overboard on this part of the assignment.</EM>
The objective is to expose you to the various ways a kernel
failure can manifest itself, in preparation for testing your own
code.  The objective is not to do the most damage possible to your
system.  In particular, it would better if you you do not trash
your hard drive, since reinstalling the entire system can take a
frustratingly long time.  </P>

<LI><P>Prepare a copy of your journal, and turn it in in class on the
due date of the assignment.</P>

<H2>Delivery Method</H2>

<OL TYPE=1>

<LI><P>Turn in all your code (both kernel and user-level) in a tar-gzipped file through 
the online Blackboard. <b>DO NOT</b> submit the entire kernel source tree. 
Submit <b>only</b> the specific files that you wrote or modified.</LI>

<li>
Sign up for your demo. At the time of your demo, bring printout of your 
journal/notes of 
the "bad" modules you tested, including copies of the code, what behavior they
caused (<I>e.g.</I>, system locked up, kernel panic), and what
output (if any) was generated.
</LI>


<LI>
<EM>Feel free to ask for information/help from other students
with the kernel configuration and similar technical set-up
details, but don't ask/let them do the work for you.  Do it on your
own. If you can't do this simple exercise by yourself now, you
won't be able to do the other exercises later.  In particular, do
not ask someone else what changes they made to the kernel module,
and what happened to them (until after the due date and all
assignments are turned in). The odds of two people in the class
having the same exact results are very slim, so if you just copy we
are likely to notice.</EM>
</LI>

<P><EM> Also note that it is possible that you may find parts of the solution to this 
assignment elsewhere on the Internet. However, you are strongly encouraged to code 
this simple assignment by yourself for three very good reasons. First, of course,
is that you want to develop your coding skills by practicing writing <b>your own</b> code.
Secondly, you will be asked to explain random parts of
the code you submit during demonstration. So understanding your own code is essential.
</EM></P>
</LI>

<LI>At the demo time you signed up for, come to
the Linux lab in G-area to demonstrate your
work. 
Be prepared to demonstrate your kernel booting up, your system calls working,
and your modules loading and executing. Explain what steps you took, 
walk through your configuration option selections, and demonstrate
the module(s) that caused crashes.  You will be asked about
your kernel's configuration, how many services you have running,
how long the system takes to boot up, and whether you are able to explain 
and demonstrate your code.</LI>
