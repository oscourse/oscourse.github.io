<P>You will walk through the
mechanical steps of configuring, compiling, installing, and
testing a kernel. This will make sure you can handle the
mechanics, let you see first-hand the time scales of some of the
development steps in kernel programming.
You will then implement a simple system call and a simple
kernel module, and write user-level applications to test 
your implementation.</P>

<H2>Important Instructions Before You start</H2>
</a>

Please read the following instructions carefully. It has important information.

<OL>

<li>
You are required to do this assignment in your VM (either CSVB or your own linux VM).
</li>
<li>
You are responsible for your VM.
</li>

</LI>

<!--
<LI>
<B>TEAMS:</B> I am requesting you all to form teams of maximum 2 members
each.  The original plan was to have each of you do the assignment
individually, which seems infeasible now due to a big resource crunch.
We have only 20 machines in this lab. There are 34 students in our section
alone. In addition, there is a strong chance that another section of 33
students may end up doing the same assignment in the Linux lab around the
same time window. This means about 67 students competing for 20 machines.
So when you work in the lab, both members of a team should use one single
machine - not two machines.
</LI>

<LI>
<B>DEMOS:</B> You can work in teams of 2, but will give the demo of the
assignment individually. Hopefully, this will force both team members to
pay attention to the entire assignment. The goal of teaming up is *NOT* to
split-up the work among each other. Rather, it is to make better use of
few computers in the lab, and hopefully, two people can pace each other's
learning better through discussions.
</LI>

<LI>
<B>LONE RANGERS:</B> It is likely that most of you would opt to work in a
team. If any of you wants to do the assignment individually, please email
me *soon*. Working alone may be fine if the number of such 'lone rangers'
is small or if you can use your own computer to do this assignment.
Otherwise, I may have to require you to work in a team to make better use
of limited computers.
</LI>

<LI>
<B>FINDING A TEAM MEMBER:</B> If you want a team member, but do not know
anyone, please email me and Rohit soon. We will try to put you in touch
with someone else in similar position.
</LI>
-->

<B>USING YOUR OWN MACHINES:</B> You can potentially use
your own machine on which you are brave enough
to experiment with Linux Kernel programming. Note that this should be a
machine that you can finally bring to the department to show your demo.
</LI>

<LI>
<B>START EARLY:</B> Get started on the assignment early. 
This cannot be stressed enough. It is not difficult, 
but some steps, such as repeatedly compiling the kernel, may take a long time. 
Try not to keep work stacked up close to the deadline because too many students may
try to access the few lab computers during the last few days.
There are many other classes using the lab, so you may even have trouble
finding a seat towards the deadline.
</LI>

<LI>
<B>ASKING FOR HELP:</B> In this assignment , you are free to ask 
for help from your classmates on Part A of the assignment, including
what configurations they use. If anything this is encouraged. However,
please do Parts B and C on your own. The thumbrule is: never 
ask for code from others OR give code to others. Of course, you are encouraged to ask
for help from the TA or the Instructor on any part of the assignment.
</LI>
</OL>


<a name=parta>
<H2>Part A: Installing, configuring, and compiling Linux Kernel 4.4.1</H2>
</a>
<p>Download, compile and boot your kernel as explained <a href=slides/lab04.pptx>lab04.pptx</a> and <a href=assignments/kernel_compilation_instructions.html> instructions </a>.

<a name=partb>
<H2>Part B: System Calls</H2>
</a>

<OL>
<LI><P>Now, using the concepts learned in the class, 
implement and test a system call that
returns the current system time by means of a call-by-reference argument.
More specifically, your system call should have the following prototype as seen
by user-level applications.

<pre>
int my_xtime(struct timespec *current_time);
</pre>

<tt>struct timespec</tt> is defined in include/linux/time.h as follows:

<pre>
struct timespec {
        time_t  tv_sec;         /* seconds */
        long    tv_nsec;        /* nanoseconds */
};
</pre>

The system call should verify that user memory space, pointed to by <tt>current_time</tt>,
is valid and writable. If not, is should return a failure (EFAULT) to the user process. 
If the memory-check succeeds, then it should retrieve the value of 
kernel's <tt>xtime</tt> variable using <tt>current_kernel_time(...)</tt> fucntion, which will read xtime atomically 
for you. Then copy the retrieved value to user space address (pointed to by current_time argument). The system call should also 
print the current time in nanoseconds, to the console using the <tt>printk()</tt> function.
</li>

<li>
Also write a user-level application which calls your new system call <tt>my_xtime(...)</tt>
and prints out the time obtained from the call-by-reference argument.
</OL>

<a name=partc>
<H2>Part C: Kernel Module</H2>
</a>

<OL>

<LI><P>
Implement a kernel module that
creates a <tt>/dev/mytime</tt> character device.
The character device should support the <tt>read()</tt> operation. When <tt>read()</tt> is
called, it should return a single string that contains the result both 
current_kernel_time() and getnstimeofday() functions in the kernel.
For example, the output should be as follows:

<pre>
current_kernel_time: 378959784 384958
getnstimeofday: 378959784 384990
</pre>
</LI>

<LI>
Also, provide a user-level application program that compares the resolution of time reported by your module with that reported by user-level gettimeofday() library routine.
<b>Understand and explain the reason for any difference in your journal.</b>

<p>
One such application could be written as follows (please fill in the missing code):
</LI>

<pre>
#define N ...

struct timeval gtodTimes[N];
char *procClockTimes[N];

...
/* allocate memory for character buffers HERE before you use them */

fd = open("/dev/mytime", O_RDONLY);
/* check for errors HERE */

for( i=0; i &lt; N; i++)
{
	gettimeofday(&ampgtodTimes[i], 0);
	bytes_read = read(fd, procClockTime[i], MAX_LENGTH);
	/* check for errors HERE */
}

close(fd);

for(i=0; i &lt; N; i++) {
	printf("...", gtodTimes[i], procClockTime[i]);
	/* fix the output format appropriately in the above line */
}

</pre>

</LI>


Run the user-level program for various values of <tt>N</tt> (both very small and very large).
In your journal, explain the reason for any differences that you observe between the three timing mechanisms.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<LI>Now, change the module so that <I>init_module()</I> returns -1,
recompile, and retest. What happens? Why?</LI>

<OL TYPE=1>

<LI><P>Turn in all your code (both kernel and user-level) in a tar-gzipped file through 
the online Blackboard. <b>DO NOT</b> submit the entire kernel source tree. 
Submit <b>only</b> the specific files that you wrote or modified.</LI>




<LI>
<EM>Feel free to ask for information/help from other students
with the kernel configuration and similar technical set-up
details, but don't ask/let them do the work for you.  Do it on your
own. If you can't do this simple exercise by yourself now, you
won't be able to do the other exercises later.  In particular, do
not ask someone else what changes they made to the kernel module,
and what happened to them (until after the due date and all
assignments are turned in). The odds of two people in the class
having the same exact results are very slim, so if you just copy we
are likely to notice.</EM>
</LI>

<P><EM> Also note that it is possible that you may find parts of the solution to this 
assignment elsewhere on the Internet. However, you are strongly encouraged to code 
this simple assignment by yourself for three very good reasons. First, of course,
is that you want to develop your coding skills by practicing writing <b>your own</b> code.
Secondly, you will be asked to explain random parts of
the code you submit during demonstration. So understanding your own code is essential.
</EM></P>

<!--
<LI> 
Be prepared to demonstrate your kernel booting up, your system calls working,
and your modules loading and executing. Explain what steps you took, 
walk through your configuration option selections, and demonstrate
the module(s) that caused crashes.  You will be asked about
your kernel's configuration, how many services you have running,
how long the system takes to boot up, and whether you are able to explain 
and demonstrate your code.</LI>
