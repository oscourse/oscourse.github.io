<H1>System Calls</H1>

<H2>Objective</H2>
<p>
You will learn how to implement a simple system call and write a user-level application to test your implementation.


<H2>Description</H2>

<ol>
<li>
Implement and test a system call that returns the current system time by means of a call-by-reference argument. More specifically, your system call should have the following prototype as seen by user-level applications.

<pre>
int my_xtime(struct timespec *current_time);
</pre>

<tt>struct timespec</tt> is defined in include/linux/time.h as follows:

<pre>
struct timespec {
        time_t  tv_sec;         /* seconds */
        long    tv_nsec;        /* nanoseconds */
};
</pre>

<p>
The system call should first verify that user memory space, pointed to by current_time, is valid and writable. If not, is should return a failure (EFAULT) to the user process. If the memory-check succeeds, then it should copy the contents of the kernel's xtime variable to user space address (pointed to by current_time argument). The system call should also print the current time in nanoseconds, to the console using the printk() function.

<li>
Also write a user-level application which calls your new system call my_xtime(...) and prints out the time obtained from the call-by-reference argument.
